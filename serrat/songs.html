                <h4>Mediterráneo</h4>
                <p>Serrat composes a song to the Mediterranean Sea, linking it to both his own life and the influence
                    he exerts on the countries he bathes. According to an urban legend Serrat may have composed the song
                    during his time locked in the Monastery of Montserrat,along with other artists,in protest at the
                    Burgos Process in the late 1970s.</p>

                <h4>Lucía</h4>
                <p>The song is a poem to love lost and impossible to forget. It describes with sublime melancholy
                    a feeling that has been forever inscribed in the memory as an unrepeatable beautiful experience.</p>

                <h4>Cantares</h4>
                <p>The song was dedicated to the poet Antonio Machado. The song, one of the most successful on the
                    album, made the Guild of Booksellers of Madrid express to Serrat its appreciation in a letter in
                    which its representatives thank Serrat for having helped to revive interest in Machado's work,
                    referring directly to the increase in the sales of books of the poet who brought with him the
                    promotion and popularization of his texts through the voice of Serrat.</p>
